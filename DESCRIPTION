Description: A simple detection theory tool for calculating detection theory 
  statistics. Assign outcomes (i.e., hit, miss, correct rejections and false 
  alarms) and calculate proportion of each conditional probability. Raw totals 
  for each outcome are also provided. Proportions can then be used to calculate 
  various detection theory statistics such as d' and criterion.
