# sdtt: Simple Detection Theory Tool

## Overview
sdtt is an R package for calculating various detection theory statistics. As well as being able to calculate statistics such as *d'* and *criterion*, the package also enables users to obtain conditional probabilities (hits, misses, false alarms, correct rejections) and proportions of each probability which can be used in calculation of the aforementioned statistics.

## Installation
You can install sdtt from [GitHub](github.com) with:

``` r

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("s-b-moore/sdtt")
```

## Future development
The package will be updated with additional functionality going forward, with the aim to make it as user-friendly as possible. If you have any suggestions for the package, please feel free to contact the package author/maintainer (contact details located in DESCRIPTION file).
